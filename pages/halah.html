    <h1> Well I think I see another side </h1>
    <p> 
        Maybe just another light that shines
        And I look over now through the door
        And I still belong to no one else
        Maybe I hold you to blame for all the reasons
        That you left.
        And close my eyes, still I see your surprise
        And you're leaving before my time.
        Baby won't you change your mind?
        Surely don't stay long I'm missing you now.
            It's like I told you I'm over you somehow
            Before I close the door I
            Need to hear you say goodbye.
            Baby won't you change your mind?
        I guess that hasn't changed someone
        Maybe nobody else could understand
        I guess that you believe you are a woman
        And that I am someone else's man
        But just before I see that you leave
        I want you to hold on to things that you said
        Baby I wish I was dead.
        Surely don't stay long I'm missing you now.
        It's like I told you I'm over you somehow
        Before I close the door I
        Need to hear you say goodbye
        Baby won't you change your mind? 
    </p>
